<h3>
  What <s>we're</s> I'm looking for
</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>It doesn't have to be a polished product.</b> I'm looking for a simple and recognisable design. If I follow through, <i>then</i> we talk about things like colours.</li>
  <li><b>It's gonna be real small.</b> Don't include complex shapes or patterns. Have a look at the apps on your own Apple Watch. How would your design look as one of them?</li>
  <li><b>You might wanna have an Apple Watch handy.</b> That's pretty self explanatory, and more for your own good than judging. While in the end doesn't matter, if you are familiar with watchOS, then you should better understand what you are making, and in turn can create an icon that works as well as possible</li>
  <li><b>Have it fit in with other apps.</b> A good icon shouldn't feel out of place or be to noisy or cluttered. A good icon fits in with other apps on the device. See if you can intergrate your icon to match other apps from Apple, and use those native apps (like Alarms, Phone, etc.) as a guide. Also remember that Apple's apps are loosely categorised with their colours. Let's not go putting a timetable app in with the call and messaging apps.</li>
</ul>
