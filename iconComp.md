<h3>
  What <s>we're</s> I'm looking for
</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>It doesn't have to be a polished product.</b> I'm looking for a design, not a 'pièce de résistance'! A simple sketch is fine. After submission and all that, <i>then</i> we talk about things like colours.</li>
  <li><b>It's gonna be real small.</b> Don't include complex shapes or patterns. Have a look at the apps on your own Apple Watch. How would your design look as one of them?</li>
  <li><b>You might wanna have an Apple Watch handy.</b> That's pretty self explanatory, and more for your own good than judging. While in the end it doesn't matter, (I get it if you don't have an Apple Watch :D,) if you are familiar with watchOS, then you should better understand what you are making, and in turn can create an icon that works as well as possible</li>
  <li><b>Have it fit in with other apps.</b> A good icon shouldn't feel out of place or be to noisy or cluttered. A good icon fits in with other apps on the device. See if you can intergrate your icon to match other apps from Apple, and use those native apps (like Alarms, Phone, etc.) as a guide. Also remember that Apple's apps are loosely categorised with their colours. Let's not go putting a timetable app in with the call and messaging apps.</li>
</ul>

### This is a really good article by Apple on designing a good icon:
**https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons**
<br>
<br>
<br>
### Keep these tips in mind, and submit as follows:
Submit **up to three circular designs** by...

- **emailing me** at **gill.palmer@education.nsw.gov.au**.
- **Finding me in person**, if you know me, etc.
<br>
<br>

## Assets

### About the app (that you're making an icon for!)
**Timetaber is, of course, a timetable app.**\
As the name suggests, Timetaber is a timetable app. It will display the course you are in, show you the next course, and tell you what is on today.
To get started, the user will 'start' a 'term' (a term being a period where the timetable app shows classes.) This is to reflect the real school terms, with the intention being that the application will not show classes during holidays, or when there is no term running. The user will specify whether the term starts on a week B or a week A.\
**These are images of the user interface:**

### Templates & Resources
**Apple have a whole bunch of development assets to help developers market their products.**\
Some of those are the product bezels (I used those to create the images above here,) and another template that we will pay more attention to is the icon template. This might not be very useful to you as you are just making a design, but you should be able to get an idea of layout, et cetera.

### https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/
**Apple Watch templates (those are what you're looking for) are about third of the way down.**
<br>
<br>

### A little on layering

You'll notice most Apple Watch apps have a gradient background with a symbol as foreground. Try to keep very close to this design. When it comes down to it, what I'm really judging on and looking for is that symbol. It should be recognisable, and intergrate with other symbols.\
All of the Apple symbols can be found in the SF Symbols app, available from **https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/**
<br>
<br>

## That about wraps it up!
### Key points to remember:
- Simplicity is key!
- A design is all I want, not a pièce de résistance.
- A recognisable symbol that fits in with other icons.
