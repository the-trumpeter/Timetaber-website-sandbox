### What is Timetaber?
Someone didn't read the homepage...\
Timetaber is an Apple Watch timetable application that I started developing in Novemberish last year (i.e, 2024.)
I constantly forget my timetable and it seemed like a pretty nifty solution, since I am very proudly a nerd and have large experience in programming already.\
That's right, Portelli, your official rival is back and he's coming in strong for a big finish - but of course, our rivalry is yet to be over...

### What is Gill Palmer?
Gill Palmer is *me*, thank you very much, and *I* am a *human*.\
I'm a great big nerd, and proud of it.
By day, I slave away at my Macbook Pro 2020 and write code (usually Swift) while my classmates exploit the hard efforts of my cousins, the video game developers.\
By evening, I do the same thing and juggle mowing the lawn and playing my trumpet, and of course the... let me see now, 1, 2, 3... 5 different ensembles I'm in, and their rehearsals.\
I also dabble in mixing and lighting engineering, and mechanical and electrical engineering.\
I'm a fan of puoltry, and we keep ducks and chickens - for cuddles, not eating, thank you...\
And I could say more but I've already pushed the amount of text around here.

### What is a flugelhorn?
Don't push it.
